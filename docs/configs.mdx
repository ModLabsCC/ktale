title: Configs

## Contracts

- `ConfigManager` loads/saves typed configs based on `ConfigKey<T>`
- migrations are explicit and versioned (`ConfigMigration`)
- storage is host/platform-specific

## Core default

`ktale-core` provides a format-agnostic `CoreConfigManager` that:

- stores text with a small header `ktaleConfigVersion: <int>`
- applies migrations to raw text before decoding

### YAML helper

`ktale-core` includes `YamlConfigCodec<T>` (kotlinx.serialization + Kaml).

If you need a different format (TOML/JSON/Jackson), provide your own `ConfigCodec`.
